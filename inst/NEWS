Changes in rgexf version 0.16.2 (2021-08-10)

New features and changes

-   We now have a hex sticker!

-   Users can now cite properly rgexf with JOSS (see
    citation(package="rgexf")).

-   Added a few extra breaks across the examples (suggested by
    @corneliusfritz).

-   Improved documentation regarding spells and dynamic graphs
    (suggested by @jonjoncardoso).

-   New head() function allows a glimpse of the n first nodes/edges.

Bug fixes

-   Passing colors with four values (alpha) no longer fails during
    checks. (reported by @IsabelFE).

-   The summary function prints nodes’ attributes as expected.

-   Hex colors now work (#41 reported by @milnus).

-   gexf.to.igraph correctly processes edge attributes (#38 reported by
    @balachia).

-   Time range is now correctly computed (#19).

-   Non-integer ids were incorrectly processed when reading GEXF files.

Changes in rgexf version 0.16.0 (2018-02-05)

New features and changes

-   Function write.gexf has a new argument for specifying the GEXF
    version for now it only changes the header.

-   plot.gexf method now uses gexf-js instead of sigma.js.

-   Now igraph.to.gexf passes arguments to gexf. Before, it was only
    passing position. This way users have more flexibility specifying
    attributes.

-   gexf’s nodesVizAtt now has defaults for color, size, and position;
    this is a requirement of gexf-js.

-   gexf ’s nodesVizAtt color and size now support passing a default for
    all the nodes. Also, color can be specified as a character scalar
    (name of the) color, or as an integer (number in colors()).

-   gexf has a new argument, rescale.node.size. When set to TRUE, the
    size vector in nodesVizAtt is rescaled such that when calling the
    plot method the largest node spans roughly 5% of the plot.

-   read.gexf now parses viz attributes (color, position, and size).

-   igraph.to.gexf and vice versa now pass viz attributes and layout.

New functions

-   The function gexf has been introduced as an eventual replacement of
    write.gexf since it makes more sense. write.gexf should only be for
    writing the gexf file on the disk (effective starting vers 0.17.0).

Misc changes

-   Modernization of the project (roxygen, new CRAN standards, etc.)

-   Updated emails.

-   Remove broken links.

-   Some data management functions were fully ported to R.

Changes in rgexf version 0.15.3 (2015-03-24)

-   Updating emails.

Changes in rgexf version 0.14.3 (2014-03-09)

New features and changes

-   New option -digits- in several functions allows controlling for
    printing precision (reported in issue 16, thanks Nico!).

-   Function -igraph.to.gexf- now imports attributes.

Bug fixes

-   Option -defaultedgetype- in the -write.gexf- function now works for
    static graphs (reported in issue 17, thanks Avitus!).

-   -datetime- time format in -write.gexf- now works for other formats
    different from numeric datetime types (reported as issue 15, thanks
    Thomas Ullmann!).

-   Correcting errors in -plot.gexf- method, now visual attributes are
    imported correctly.

Development

-   Option -keepFactors- default is now in -FALSE- (used to be in
    -TRUE-). When set to -TRUE- and there are factors, a warning message
    will appear (reported in issue 18, thanks to Tim Smith!).

Changes in rgexf version 0.13.11 (2013-11-27)

Bug fixes

-   Included class checks in -gexf- class functions (thanks to Samuel
    Finegold).

-   write.gexf does not fails when dynamics different from double are
    passed (thank you, Samuel Finegold!).

-   Passing weights from igraph to gexf has now been fix (thank you
    Roberto Brunelli!).

-   Fixing encoding issues thanks to Yong Cha’s suggestion (thank you!).

Changes in rgexf version 0.13.8 (2013-08-06)

New features and changes

-   New S3 method plot.gexf, implemented by Joshua B Kunst, shows the
    graph in the web browser by means of Sigma.js (!).

-   New functions igraph.to.gexf and gexf.to.igraph converts objects
    between igraph and gexf classes. Colors and attributes are
    preserved.

Development

-   Improving general documentation.

-   Just starting to add new options to add.gexf.node/edge, more
    precisely, passing attributes.

Changes in rgexf version 0.13.05 (2013-05-09)

Bug fixes

-   sprintf error when using other formats rather than double (issue
    10).

-   in .addNodesEdges, add support to case “!attributes &&
    vizattributes” (issue 9).

Changes in rgexf version 0.13.03 (2013-03-14)

New features and changes

-   New functions add.node.spell and add.edge.spell now allow to work
    with nodes and edges time spells.

-   New function check.dpl.edges, written in C, analyzes links and
    reports duplicates (marking them) and number of times the same link
    is repeated considering if the graph is directed or not.

-   New function switch.edges, also written in C, allows to order links
    representations (source and target) in order to set the smallest id
    as source and the highest as target.

-   Function write.gexf now has an improved error handler. Now parses
    objects before even opening the XML graph.

-   Edges support id assignment and labeling.

Bug fixes

-   Small bug detected in viz attributes fixed.

-   Edges thickness viz att XML representation (viz:thickness) was
    replaced by viz:size (as it should be).

-   “Library” replaced by “Package” everywhere (ups!)

Development

-   .addNodesEdges rewritten now works faster in most of CPUs (some of
    them with very high speedups) (Thanks to Duncan Temple Lang, RXML
    author)

-   Several code routines have been extracted from “bigger functions”
    and written as functions themselves.

Changes in rgexf version 0.13.01 (2013-01-04)

New features and changes

-   New functions new.gexf.graph, add.gexf.node, add.gexf.edge,
    rm.gexf.node and rm.gexf.edge allow to build and manipulate gexf
    objects from scratch.

-   New function read.gexf allows to import gexf files as gexf class
    objects.

-   gexf function now it is called write.gexf.

-   Edges now allow weighting.

-   Viz Attributes (color, shape, size, etc.) can be included in both,
    nodes and edges.

-   Real-life datasets have been included.

-   New function edge.list builds a dataframe of nodes from an edge
    list.

-   New methods for gexf objects: print.gexf and summary.gexf.

Development

-   gexf class objects are now a standard.

-   Function gexf is now named write.gexf.

-   Faster net build.

-   More demos + improve ones.

-   Cleaner code.

    “attvalue”.

    from XML values at ids, source, target, etc.

Changes in rgexf version 0.12.03 (2012-03-05)
