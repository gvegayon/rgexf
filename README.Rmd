# rgexf: Build, Import and Export GEXF Graph Files <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="140"/>

The first R package to work with GEXF graph files (used in Gephi and others). Using XML library, it allows the user to easily build/read graph files including attributes, GEXF viz attributes (such as color, size, and position), network dynamics (for both edges and nodes, including spells) and edges weighting. Users can build/handle graphs element-by-element or massively through data-frames, visualize the graph on a web browser through ~~sigmajs javascript~~ [gexf-js](https://github.com/raphv/gexf-js) library and interact with the igraph package.

## Installation

To install the latest version of `rgexf` you can use `devtools`

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("gvegayon/rgexf")
```

The more stable (but old) version of `rgexf` can be found on CRAN too:

```
install.packages("rgexf")
```

## Example 1: Static net ##
```{r}
# Loading the package
library(rgexf)

# Creating a group of individuals and their relations
people <- data.frame(matrix(c(1:4, 'juan', 'pedro', 'matthew', 'carlos'),ncol=2))
people
```

```{r}
# Defining the relations structure
relations <- data.frame(matrix(c(1,4,1,2,1,3,2,3,3,4,4,2), ncol=2, byrow=T))
relations
```

```{r}
# Getting things done
write.gexf(people, relations)
```


## Example 2: Dynamic net ##

```{r}
# Defining the dynamic structure, note that there are some nodes that have NA at the end.
time<-matrix(c(10.0,13.0,2.0,2.0,12.0,rep(NA,3)), nrow=4, ncol=2)
time
```

```{r}
# Getting things done
write.gexf(people, relations, nodeDynamic=time)
```



## Example 3: More complex... Dynamic graph with attributes both for nodes and edges##

First we define dynamics

```{r}
time.nodes<-matrix(c(10.0,13.0,2.0,2.0,12.0,rep(NA,3)), nrow=4, ncol=2)
time.nodes

time.edges<-matrix(c(10.0,13.0,2.0,2.0,12.0,1,5,rep(NA,5)), nrow=6, ncol=2)
time.edges
```

Now we define the attribute values

```{r}
# Defining a data frame of attributes for nodes and edges
node.att <- data.frame(letrafavorita=letters[1:4], numbers=1:4, stringsAsFactors=F)
node.att

edge.att <- data.frame(letrafavorita=letters[1:6], numbers=1:6, stringsAsFactors=F)
edge.att

# Getting the things done
write.gexf(nodes=people, edges=relations, edgeDynamic=time.edges,
           edgesAtt=edge.att, nodeDynamic=time.nodes, nodesAtt=node.att)
```

# Session info

```{r}
devtools::session_info()
```
