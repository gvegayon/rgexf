Description: The first R package to work with GEXF graph files (used in Gephi and others). Using XML library, it allows the user to easily build/read graph files including attributes, GEXF viz attributes (such as colour, size, and position), network dynamics (for both edges and nodes, including spells) and edges weighting. Users can build/handle graphs element-by-element or massively through data-frames.
