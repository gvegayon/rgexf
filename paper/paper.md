# Summary

First introduced in 2012, the rgexf package for the R programming language was the first effort to make the Graph Exchange XML Format (@heymann2009gexf) specification available to the R world. With more than 500,000 downloads (https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/), it is one of the most popular ways to incorporate GEXF files into the R programming language environment.

Developed by the Gephi Core Group (@bastian2009gephi), the GEXF specification is a flexible and widely used format to describe graphs. Although it has not been updated since 2009, the GEXF format has been introduced to several tools and programming environments. A few examples include:

- The python library `networkx` (@hagberg2008exploring) 

- The stand-alone software `Cytoscape` (@smoot2011cytoscape)

- The JavaScript library `sigma.js` (https://simga.js)

- The java library `gexf4j` (https://github.com/francesco-ficarola/gexf4j) 

- The JavaScript library `gexf-js` (https://github.com/raphv/gexf-js)

Besides the rgexf package, other R packages provide functions that interact with GEXF files:

- `sigmajs`: Interface to 'Sigma.js' Graph Visualization Library (@Coene2018)

- `vkR`: Access to VK API via R (@vkR)

- `microeco`: Microbial Community Ecology Data Analysis (@microeco) 

- `netCoin`: Interactive Analytic Networks (@netCoin)

Nevertheless, the rgexf package continues to be the de-facto tool to interact with GEXF files in R.

# Features

Beyond reading and writing GEXF files from within R, the rgexf R package has various other features that can help to create beautiful network visualizations, in particular:

- Using gexf objects--the main class implemented in rgexf--users can create GEXF objects from scratch, adding and removing nodes and edges--including features--as needed.

- Users of the igraph package can directly convert objects between gexf and igraph classes.

- Thanks to the gexf-js javascript library, users can immediately visualize their network objects in the web browser.

Because of these and other reasons, the rgexf package has been featured in many scientific papers (@Starr2017, @Kauffman2018, @Leclerc2018, and @Alsaedi2016, among others), stating the great utility that this R package has provided to the community. The rgexf package is available in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and the project repository at https://github.com/gvegayon/rgexf.
